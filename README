This is not a cricket game. Hricket is a scoring application that will save you from having to draw up a Cricket 
scorecard if you don't have a chalkboard, or just don't feel like getting chalk on your hands. ;)

It supports two players, and will likely never support more. The bullseye is represented as the number '25'. This was 
done to avoid unnecessary complexity, and might change in future versions, but for now, the bullseye is 25. When you hit 
a bullseye, you enter 25, and not bullseye or b. If you try to enter those, it will tell it that it's invalid and have 
you try again.

The recommended way to use this application, is to begin by opening it up and entering the names of both players. You'll 
then want player 1 to throw 3 darts. Enter each dart into the application one at a time. You'll type the number you hit 
on the board, a single space, and the number of markings. For instance, if you hit the number 16 in the treble, you 
would enter '16 3'. If you hit 20 in the single you would enter '20 1'. For numbers lower than 15, which are not used in 
standard Cricket games, enter 0. When all numbers are opened/closed by one of the players, that player's score will be ran against the 
other players score, and if it's higher, that player will be declared the winner. Otherwise, the other player wins.

You are expected to know how to play Cricket before using this application. This is not a Cricket tutorial, and the 
application will not teach you to play Cricket.

In the next version: 

Turn prompts to show you whos turn it is at any given time so you don't have to keep track of it in your head.

A way to end your turn, so if every dart is nothing useful, you don't have to enter 0 every time. This would also be useful in case you only throw a single good dart, that way you could just enter that dart, and then end the turn.



I made this application our of necessity and boredom. Enjoy.
