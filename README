This is not a cricket game. Hricket is a scoring application that will save you from having to draw up a Cricket scorecard if you don't have a chalkboard, or just don't feel like getting chalk on your hands. ;)

It supports two players, and will likely never support more. The bullseye is represented as the number '21'. This was done to avoid unnecessary complexity, and might change in future versions, but for now, the bullseye is 21. When you hit a bullseye, you enter 21, and not bullseye or b. If you try to enter those, it will tell it that it's invalid and have you try again.

The recommended way to use this application, is to begin by opening it up and entering the names of both players. You'll then want player 1 to throw 3 darts. Enter each dart into the application one at a time. You'll type the number you hit on the board, a single space, and the number of markings. For instance, if you hit the number 16 in the treble, you would enter '16 3'. If you hit 20 in the single you would enter '20 1'. For numbers lower than 15, which are not used in standard Cricket games, you can either enter 0, or go ahead and enter the number you hit and the number of markings, but that will take longer. When all numbers are closed by one of the players, that player's score will be ran against the other players score, and if it's higher, that player will be declared the winner. Otherwise, the other player wins.

You are expected to know how to play Cricket before using this application. This is not a Cricket tutorial, and the application will not teach you to play Cricket.



I made this application our of necessity and boredom. Enjoy.
